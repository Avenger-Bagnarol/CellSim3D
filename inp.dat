TRAJECTORY WRITE INTERVAL (Must be < Time_Steps and Time_steps%trajWriteInt == 0)
countOnlyInternal (0 - no, 1 - yes)

No of equillibration time steps 
Trajectory File name (extension does matter)
Use population modelling (0==No and 1==No)
Maximum Food for population modelling
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Transient food consumption
Food consumed to create new cell (cells can't divide if this much extra food doesn't exist)
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Food released back into the system when a cell dies
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Hayflick limit (the max number of times a cell can divide; ignored if 0);
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Max amount of time a cell can live 
Maximum growth pressure (sets max growth rate)
