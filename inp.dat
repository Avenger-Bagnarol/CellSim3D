RESTART
TRAJECTORY WRITE INTERVAL (Must be < Time_Steps and Time_steps%trajWriteInt == 0)
countOnlyInternal (0 - no, 1 - yes)
radFrac (If not between 0.4-0.8 or < 0 , countOnlyInternal = 0 always)
overWriteMitIndFile
New cell count interval (Must be < Time_Steps and Time_steps%newCellCountInt == 0)
No of equillibration time steps 
Trajectory File name (extension does matter)
Use population modelling (0==No and 1==Yes)
Maximum Food for population modelling
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Transient food consumption
Food consumed to create new cell (cells can't divide if this much extra food doesn't exist)
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Food released back into the system when a cell dies
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Hayflick limit (the max number of times a cell can divide; ignored if 0);
[NOT IMPLEMENTED] Max amount of time a cell can live 
Maximum growth pressure (sets max growth rate) 
Use walls in the simulation? (0 = no, 1 = yes)
Axis the walls are perpendicular to (Z for XY plane, etc)
Separation between two walls
length of walls in no. of cell diameters
width of walls in no. of cell diameters
threshold distance for repulsion
